Project Objectives:
Reinforce your skills of using control flow statements (such as while loop, if-else, switch) and Scanner to interactively process a user's keyboard inputs.

Description:
In this assignment, you are required to implement a simple command line app to convert different metrics. You can find a list of common conversions from Metric Conversion charts and calculators (metric-conversions.org).
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Here are the requirements:

1. Your app (it is a quite simple command line app without GUI) must be able to do at least 4 different conversions (the more the better). For example, kg to lb, gram to ounces, km to mile, mm to inch, etc.

2. Your app should continue accepting user inputs until the user inputs something like "exit" or "-1" (you can decide which word to use as the cue to exit the program).

3. Your README.md file in your GitHub and your command line app should contain some basic instructions on how to use your app, for example, your app may print the following statement when starting the program:

"Welcome to metric converter! 
Please input your query. For example, 1 km = m. 
Enter 'exit' or '-1' to exit the program"
If a user input something that is not handled, you should print something to remind the user the valid input format, e.g.,
"Your input is not currently handled by this app, please input another query, for example, 1 kg = lb"

4. Export your project to a .jar file. So that users can directly use the .jar file to convert metrics.

NOTE: FOR NOW, THE MAIN CODE IS GIVEN IN THE Metric_Converter_main.java FILE.
How to run the code from Metric_Converter_main:
1. Copy and paste the 70 lines of code from the Metric_Converter_main.java file in the project. 
2. When you run the code, in your terminal, two lines are printed (i) Asks the user to input the query and provides and example on how to enter the query into the terminal. (ii) Asks the user to enter 'exit' or '-1' to exit the program, if the user decides not to run the code.
3. Once the user inputs the query, then the system genrates the converted units.
